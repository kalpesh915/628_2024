            CSS HSL Colors
            HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
            HSL Value In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
            hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
            Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
            Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
            Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
